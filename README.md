# Python Learn Marathon
This is a repo for a Learn Python For Charity Event. 

**NOTE: Codez from the first session have been pushed to the repo and the video can be found [here](./session_one/README.md) until April 5th. We are working on pushing those materials to youtube and will make that link available here.**

~~The event will be held on Twitch **Sun March 22, 2020 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM EST**. Depending on success will be continued on~~ 
~~The next session is held **Sun March 29, 2020 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM EST**.~~
The next session is held **Sun April 19, 2020 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM EST**. Windstream had addressed my connectivity issues so the broadcast should stay strong.
We have met the fundraising goals for Lucimia Foundation that is being held at our local school, thank you all that participated.

## We will use Repl.it for the coding session
Once the session is ready to start click the link below to run this session in **Repl.it**:

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/ilyaGotfryd/python-learn-marathon)](https://repl.it/github/ilyaGotfryd/python-learn-marathon)

The teaching is going to be done in this environment to minimize setup problems. I will try to cover runing Python in your environment to a degree and we can have a Q&A about it in the course of the event.

## Practice Typing Python before the lesson to keep up
To keep up with the lesson please practice typing Python so that special Symbols and scoping are easy to grasp at the fast pace.

## Screen setup for type along

If you do not have dual-screen setup, you will probably have an easier time if you set up twitch on your smart TV and watch this broadcast there so that your computer is fully available for coding:

[Twitch on Apple TV](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitch-live-game-streaming/id460177396#?platform=appleTV)|
[Twitch on Roku](https://www.howtogeek.com/369438/how-to-watch-twitch-on-roku/)|
[Twitch on Cromecast](https://chromecastappstips.com/cast-twitch-on-chromecast/)|
[Twitch on FireTV](https://www.amazon.com/Twitch-Interactive-Inc/dp/B007SOQBCM)


We are going to be broadcasting in as zoomed-in of a mode as possible so that you could split your screen if you are on a single monitor and code along with us. Here is the recommended setup:

![Screen Split View](https://github.com/ilyaGotfryd/python-learn-marathon/raw/master/screen-split-view.png)

This setup suggests that you place two windows side by side and collapse alls the side-bars in both windows. One thing to be aware of is that when you will be executing your code results will be showing up in the console window collapsed in the image to the right so you will need to expand it when the command is running.

## Lesson plan in a mind map
This mind map covers the lesson plan for two sessions. We are going to get through Python basics in the first session and go into more advanced topics depending on the success of the first session.

## Future plans and related projects

* Let's review/learn more Python topics - I am looking to create more of these sessions, but only an hour or two long discussing libraries and other modern Python capabilitie.
* Gagarin Academy - [sample](./gagarin-academy/GAGARIN_ACADEMY.md)
